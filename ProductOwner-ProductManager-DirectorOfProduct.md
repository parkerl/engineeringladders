# Product Owner vs Product Manager vs Director

It is very common for companies to mix the Product Owner and Product Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, 
their focus is different: the Product Owner is in charge of delivering features and functionality suites for a single *Product* 
while the Product Manager is in charge of analyzing customer feedback and market information in order to enhance or
create multiple *Products*.

If the team is small and/or the leader has a lot of experience as Product Manager and Product Owner, the same person might 
perform both roles. But as the products and team grow in size and complexity, 
there will be a necessity to have different people for each role.

The Director is in charge of both the *People* and *Products*.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

| [Product Owner](ProductOwner.md) (Product) | [Product Manager](ProductManager.md) (Products and Customers) | [Director](Director.md) (Products and People)|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delivery process | Customer and Market Needs | Career Planning, Promotions and Coaching |
| Project management | Customer relationship management | People management |

The last point on each role highlights the fact that the lists are not mutually exclussive, 
and therefore many of the points from one side are also important on the other side too. 
An Product Manager or Director that can't understand the challenges of each product and team won't be successful at the role, 
the same is true for a Product Manager that doesn't understand the career paths of the Product Owners in the team. 

Having said that, although it is important for an Product Manager to be able act as a Product Owner and vice versa, 
it also critical for them to focus and excel at the right things. Although there is a clear overlap and an opportunity 
for collaboration, both positions must know well who is responsible for what to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
